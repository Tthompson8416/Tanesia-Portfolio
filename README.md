# Tanesia-Portfolio
I created a portfolio to introduce myself and showcase my projects to potential employers. I coordinated a color theme that fits with my personality. I creadted navigation links within the header that directs the user to speific section of my page. In the work section I added clickable images that direct the user the projects landing page. The contact me section has links that direct the user to my email,linkedIn, and GitHub. My phone number is also included in the contact section. Finally, in the resume section, I included a link that when the user clicks on it will open an image of my current resume.
